# **Portfolio of Data Science Projects**

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases my work on data science projects. 
Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualisation.

## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Machine Learning**

**Hybrid Recommender System (Python)**  
- Designed a recommender system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.  
- Tackled challenges such as the cold start problem, data sparsity, and managing large datasets.  
- Achieved a **94% grade** on the assignment and ranked **18th out of 95 students** on the Kaggle leaderboard.  

**Feature Selection and Implementation of Regression and Classification (R)**  
- Conducted feature selection using statistical tests (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis) .  
- Implemented regression and classification models (Random Forest) .  


### **2. ESG Survey Data Analysis**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on survey data about ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) implementation in Malaysia.
- Highlighted key adoption trends and challenges across industries.
- Delivered actionable insights to stakeholders.

### **3. Data Wrangling (Python)**

Data wrangling is divided into two parts:

#### **Part 1: Data Extraction and Bigram Creation**
- **Objective**: Extract relevant text patterns from a **CSV file** using **Regex (Regular Expressions)** and process the data to generate meaningful **bigrams**.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Utilized regex to clean and extract structured data from raw text fields in the CSV file.
  - Generated bigrams to identify and analyze frequently co-occurring word pairs for insights and trends.

#### **Part 2: Data Cleaning and Wrangling for Predictive Analysis**
- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for **predictive analysis** using **Linear Regression**.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to improve data quality.
  - Applied transformations to normalize and scale numerical features for optimal model performance.

### **4. Data Visualization (Power BI, Tableau, R Shiny, D3.js)**

This section showcases visualisations created using **Tableau**, **R Shiny**, and **D3.js** to analyze and present insights from Victoria road accident data.


#### **Folder: Power BI**

**HR Dashboard**, providing key insights into:
- Employees **due for promotion**
- Employees at risk of **retrenchment**
- Breakdown by job levels and departments

**View the Dashboard**
Due to platform limitations, the interactive Power BI dashboard cannot be embedded directly. However, you can:
 **View the Offline Report**: [Download the PDF version](https://github.com/EmmanuelleHC/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Visualisation/Power%20BI/Clustered%20HR%20Data/HRData.pdf) 

**About the Dashboard**
This dashboard helps HR teams analyze:
- **Promotion Gaps**: Identifying employees who are overdue for promotion.
- **Retrenchment Risk**: Highlighting employees most at risk.
- **Job Levels and Departments**: Understanding trends across the organisation.

### **Folder: Tableau Report**

1. **Victoria Road Accident Data Analysis**  
   - **Objective**: Conduct data analysis and identify irregularities in Victoria road accident data.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Developed a report to uncover trends and patterns in accident data.  
     - Highlighted data irregularities and provided insights for better decision-making.  

2. **Interactive E-commerce Sales Dashboard**  
   - **Objective**: Create an interactive dashboard to track e-commerce sales performance and trends.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Visualised key metrics such as revenue, sales performance, and customer behaviour.

#### **Folder: R Shiny**
- **Objective**: Develop an interactive data visualization tool using **R Shiny**.
- **Key Features**:
  - Built a dynamic web application to visualise and explore Victoria road accident data.

#### **Folder: D3.js**
- **Objective**: Implement custom visualisations using **D3.js** to represent road accident trends in Victoria.
