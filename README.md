# **Portfolio of Data Science Projects**

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases my work on data science projects. 
Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualisation.

## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Hybrid Recommender System (Python)**
- Developed a recommender system combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.
- Addressed challenges like cold start, data sparsity, and large dataset management.
- Achieved **94% grade** in the assignment and ranked **18th out of 95 students** on the Kaggle leaderboard.

### **2. ESG Survey Data Analysis**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on survey data about ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) implementation in Malaysia.
- Highlighted key adoption trends and challenges across industries.
- Delivered actionable insights to stakeholders.

### **3. Data Wrangling (Python)**

Data wrangling is divided into two parts:

#### **Part 1: Data Extraction and Bigram Creation**
- **Objective**: Extract relevant text patterns from a **CSV file** using **Regex (Regular Expressions)** and process the data to generate meaningful **bigrams**.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Utilized regex to clean and extract structured data from raw text fields in the CSV file.
  - Generated bigrams to identify and analyze frequently co-occurring word pairs for insights and trends.

#### **Part 2: Data Cleaning and Wrangling for Predictive Analysis**
- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for **predictive analysis** using **Linear Regression**.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to improve data quality.
  - Applied transformations to normalize and scale numerical features for optimal model performance.

### **3. Data Visualization (Tableau, R Shiny, D3.js)**

This section showcases visualisations created using **Tableau**, **R Shiny**, and **D3.js** to analyze and present insights from Victoria road accident data.

#### **Folder: Tableau Report**
- **Objective**: Perform data analysis and identify irregularities in Victoria road accident data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Created interactive dashboards to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
  - Highlighted data irregularities and insights for improved decision-making.

#### **Folder: R Shiny**
- **Objective**: Develop an interactive data visualization tool using **R Shiny**.
- **Key Features**:
  - Built a dynamic web application to visualise and explore Victoria road accident data.

#### **Folder: D3.js**
- **Objective**: Implement custom visualisations using **D3.js** to represent road accident trends in Victoria.
